        <p>The word “hangry” has become widespread across popular culture in the last few years. It efficiently captures
            the feeling of being irrationally angry when you allow yourself to get too hungry. When you feel this way,
            it becomes clear that finding a restaurant can be a real pain.
        </p>
        <p>Information about restaurants in your area is scattered across multiple platforms, making it hard to find
            quickly. This is especially true if you find it important to frequent locally owned restaurants. The
            available platforms are often overwhelming to navigate and are not visually appealing. Frustration with the
            process is almost certain.
        </p>
        <p>BLOCAL is an app that allows users to find information about locally owned restaurants quickly in one
            easy-to-use app. BLOCAL also offers users the On the Fly feature which will give an instant restaurant
            suggestion. Users have the option to use On the Fly without an account, or to create an account and save
            their preferences to make their On the Fly suggestions more personalized. Creating an account also allows
            users to save their favorite restaurants and write reviews.</p>

    <section class="blocalResearch" id="blocalResearch">

            </h2>
        </div>
        <p>We began the research process with a proto-persona - Margot Potter, age 33 from Castle Rock, CO. Our
            hypothesis about her goals and pain points include liking to spend her money locally, wanting trustworthy
            reviews, and wanting to avoid large chain restaurants. The information gained in the process of developing
            the proto-persona helped us develop an interview plan and survey questions.
        </p>
        <img src="./Assets/BLOCAL_ProtoPersona.png" alt="Hypothesis regarding a BLOCAL user">
        <h4 class="font2 researchSubtitle">Interviews</h4>
        <p>We conducted five semi-structured interviews with a 20 minute time limit. All interviews were conducted over
            Zoom.</p>
        <div class="blocalResearchObjectives">
            <h4 class="font2">Interview Objectives</h4>
            <div class="blocalObjectivesList">
                <ul>
                    <li>What methods are users currently using to find new restaurants and activities?
                    </li>
                    <li>What leads users to be interested in trying a new place?</li>
                    <li>What resources do users use/trust to find accurate reviews?</li>
                    <li>How much emphasis do users put on supporting local businesses?</li>
                    <li>What pain points exist in breaking away from routine and finding new places?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We created a list of questions to help us answer these objectives. Questions covered how the interviewee
            finds restaurants and how much time they spend to do so, what hesitations they have before trying somewhere
            new, and their satisfaction with recent experiences among other things.</p>
        <p>During interviews we found all five subjects used multiple platforms for researching restaurants and had a
            strong preference for good photos. They also had limited patience for the research, especially when hungry.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font2">Survey</h4>
        <img src="./Assets/BLOCAL_survey.png" alt="Pie chart with results of survey question" id="blocalSurveyImage">
        <p>We also conducted a survey to help us get data from a wider group of people. We used Google Forms to create a
            10 question, multiple choice answer survey. The survey was posted on social media by all team members.
        </p>
        <p>We received 187 responses. The results indicate that most respondents do find it important to choose locally
            owned restaurants. However, we were surprised to find that most people did not consider it hard to go
            outside their comfort zone when looking for restaurants.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font2">Competitors</h4>
        <p>We considered five companies when researching competitors: Tripadvisor, OpenTable, Yelp, DoorDash, and Google
            Maps. DoorDash and Google Maps are indirect competitors - DoorDash because their focus is food delivery and
            Google Maps because navigation is their primary function. However, both of these apps provide users with
            information about restaurants in their area.</p>

                        are reliable - it is very easy for companies to purchase fake positive Yelp reviews.

        <p>Data from interviews was used to create an Affinity Diagram with Point of View Statements.
        </p>
        <p>We then developed a User Persona. Abby Hummel is a 33 year old biology teacher living in Portland, OR with
            her husband. She finds it hard to tell if restaurants are locally owned and likes to see photos when she is
            doing her research.
        </p>
        <img src="./Assets/BLOCAL_UserPersona.png" alt="Details about BLOCAL User">
        <p>From this data we developed the following Problem Statement: <em>We observed when users are hungry they make
                impromptu decisions because information on current apps is cluttered and overwhelming. How might we
                streamline search information into a simple and visually appealing layout so restaurant goers
                successfully
                choose a restaurant and return to the app to leave a review?</em></p>

            id="blocalPriorMatrix">
        <p>As a group, we brainstormed features for BLOCAL to best meet the user's needs. We started with the “I Like, I
            Wish, What if?” method and then took the best ideas and sorted them on a prioritization matrix. One idea was
            to create a random restaurant generator. We called this feature “On the Fly”.</p>
        <p>Next, we created several user flows in Miro - onboarding, new user preferences, account holder On the Fly,
            non-account holder On the Fly, and a search and review flow. Once we developed these flows, we decided to
            focus on the preferences and two On the Fly flows to best meet the user's need for quick recommendations.
            Below is the On the Fly flow for a user with no account.</p>
        <img src="./Assets/BLOCAL_OTFNoAccount.png" alt="Flow diagram of user path" id="blocalUserFlow">
        <p>This section of the user flow assumes the user has chosen not to make an account. Items in purple represent
            backend database functions that the user will not see.</p>
        <p>We developed a scenario for our User Persona. We looked at how the user may be feeling at each step of the
            process of using BLOCAL. We then created a storyboard to illustrate the experience.

        <p>We tested our individual prototypes to determine what options worked best for the users. The testing plan
            included three tasks - use On the Fly without an account, use On the Fly with an account, and set user
            preferences as a new user.</p>
        <p>We found that our coaching was not working. Users did not understand what the On the Fly feature does and
            often got confused with the Browse option on the starting screen. Users also did not understand the
            difference between the like and bookmark features.
        </p>
        <p>We adjusted by adding two extra coaching screens, but shortening the information on each. We created an
            On the Fly icon that carries throughout the app to make it more recognizable. Also, we removed the
            Browse and bookmark features as these seemed to only confuse users.</p>

        <p>I learned a lot from this project. We initially hypothesized that people have a hard time going out of their
            comfort zone and trying new restaurants. Our interviews and the survey showed this wasn't generally the
            case. The real issue was finding reliable information on restaurants quickly.
        </p>
        <p>It was also a challenge to narrow our scope. With only three weeks for the entire project, we had to be very
            specific about what we wanted to work on. We originally hoped to add other locally owned businesses - bars,
            clubs, activities, etc. but we didn't have the time. If we were to continue this project, we would have
            liked to add a “plan your night” type of feature where the user could put in an area and distance they'd
            like to travel and they'd get a plan for their evening with restaurants and activities.
